### **Functional demo projects for displaying programming competency**

### Hello! Thank you for taking the time to check out this repo! Here, I have pushed up a few of my own personal projects that I believe show a large extent of my coding abilities... 

## 1) BeerDieStatRecorder

>**Timeframe for Completion: 1 month**

**Description:**
Beer Die is a game that has grown popular over recent years. As my freinds and I began to learn and grow our skills, we realized that our current method for keeping track of our wins, losses, etc, which involved a small, old whiteboard, was too primitive for our use. We needed a more modern way to compete and assert our dominance over lesser, more mediocre players! And that is when this program was born...

**What is Involved?**
This program relies on Twilio SMS services for the creation of webhooks activated through personal phones. An SMS message with game information is sent by a user, which sets off an AWS Lambda function to store the data in a DynamoBD table. The user may create their own profile, edit there game stats, check other players game stats, and reference a list of commands accepted by the program. Storage in DynamoBD allows for persistent data to be referenced and edited at will by the user.

**Programming Skills/Tools/Concpets Used:**
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks 
- Visual Studio Code
- AWS Lambda
- AWS DynamoDB
- Twilio
- Webhooks
- Persistent Data
- Software deployment

## 2) RealEstateInvestmentFinder

>**Timeframe for Completion: 1 day**

**Description:**
Investing in Real Estate is something I have been personally insterested in for a while. To assist me in finding prospective investment opportunities, I developed this program one day while I was home sick from work...

**What is Involved?**
This program utilizes Python packages, Pandas and PyWebIO, to create a basic web-app capable of identifying potential rental property investments. After inputing some basic personal financial information, this notebook will launch a simple web-app for entering information for a prospective rental property investment. The program will use this information to calculate expected down payment information, monthly cash flow, recomended monthly reserves based on nieghborhood and house price, net worth return on investment after 1 year, along with other useful information -- all for various different financing options. The result of the program is a Pandas DataFrame with all the necessary information needed for assessing the investment's profitability. 

**Programming Skills/Tools/Concpets Used:**
- Python
-   Pandas
-   PyWebIO
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Full Stack Development
