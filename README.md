# Sean Dickson's Software Development Portfolio

Welcome! üëã

Thanks for visiting my portfolio repository!

Here you‚Äôll find a collection of personal projects that highlight my approach to problem-solving, software design, and technical creativity. Each project reflects how I build real-world, practical solutions.

## 1. Huffman Encoder | Mar 2025

**Project Description:**

HuffmanEncoder is a Python-based implementation of the classic Huffman coding algorithm, used in data compression. It efficiently converts text or files into compact binary representations by assigning shorter codes to more frequent characters.

**How It Works:**
  - Encodes and decodes arbitrary strings or files into binary form.
  - Demonstrates tree-based data structures, priority queues, and bitwise manipulation.
  - Designed with modular Python classes for reusability and clarity.

**Core Skills:** 

Python, Algorithm Design, OOP, Recursion, Data Structures

## 2. Multi-Sorter | Apr 2025

**Project Description:**

Multi-Sorter is a command-line utility that allows users to experiment with multiple sorting algorithms side-by-side. It was designed as a playground for understanding algorithmic complexity and runtime trade-offs in real-world data handling.

**How It Works:**
  - Supports both built-in and custom sorting methods (e.g., insertion sort, merge sort).
  - Outputs detailed runtime analysis for comparison between algorithms.

**Core Skills:** 

Python, CLI Applications, Complexity Analysis, Algorithm Optimization

## 3. Beer Die Stat Recorder | Aug 2020

>‚ÄúBecause friendly competition deserves better than a whiteboard.‚Äù

**Project Description:**

Beer Die is a competitive game my friends and I used to play often. Tracking our wins, losses, and stats on a whiteboard just wasn‚Äôt cutting it ‚Äî so I built a cloud-powered stats app that automates everything.

**How It Works:**

Uses Twilio SMS webhooks to trigger game data uploads from text messages.
  - AWS Lambda functions handle message parsing and data processing.
  - AWS DynamoDB provides persistent, cloud-hosted storage for user stats.
  - Players can view, edit, and compare their records through text commands.

**Note:**

This is an earlier project, included here to illustrate the progression of my software development skills over time. The system has been archived due to AWS/Twilio costs, but the full source code and workflow are preserved here for demonstration.

**Core Skills:**
  - Python, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Twilio API
  - Webhooks & Cloud Functions
  - API Design, Data Persistence, Error Handling
  - Deployment Automation
  - Virtual Environments (environment.yml)
