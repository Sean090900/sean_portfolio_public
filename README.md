#### Personal projects for displaying programming competency

#### Hello! Thank you for taking the time to check out this repo! Here, I have pushed up a few of my personal projects that I believe show a large extent of my coding abilities... 

## 1) BeerDieStatRecorder

**Duration of Project:**
>1 month

**Description:**

>Beer Die is a game that has grown popular over recent years. As my freinds and I began to learn and grow our skills, we realized that our current win/loss record strategy, involving an old whiteboard, was far too primitive for our purposes. We needed a more modern way to compete and assert our dominance over lesser, more mediocre players! And that is when the BeerDieStatRecorder was born...

**What is Involved?**

>This program relies on Twilio SMS services for the creation of webhooks activated through personal phones. An SMS message with game information is sent by a user, which sets off an AWS Lambda function to store the data in a DynamoDB table. The user may create their own profile, edit their game stats, check other players' game stats, and reference a list of commands accepted by the program. Storage in DynamoBD allows for persistent data to be referenced and edited by the user at will.
>This program is no longer maintained due to the associated costs, so a demo is not available.

**Programming Skills/Tools/Concpets Used:**

>- Python
>- Jupyter Notebooks 
>- Visual Studio Code
>- AWS Lambda
>- AWS DynamoDB
>- Twilio
>- Webhooks
>- Persistent Data
>- Software deployment
>- Testing, Error Catching, and Debugging
>- Virtual Environments (environment.yml files)

## 2) RealEstateInvestmentFinder

**Duration of Project:**
>1 day

**Description:**

>Investing in Real Estate is something I have been personally insterested in for a while. To assist me in finding prospective investment opportunities, I developed this program...

**What is Involved?**

>This program utilizes Python packages, Pandas and PyWebIO, to create a basic web-app capable of calculating financial metrics for potential rental property investments. After inputing some basic financial information, this notebook will launch a simple web-app for entering information for a prospective rental property investment. The program will use this information to calculate expected down payment information, monthly cash flow, recomended monthly reserves based on neighborhood and house price, net worth return on investment after 1 year, along with other useful information -- all for various different financing options. The result of the program is a Pandas DataFrame with all the necessary information needed for assessing the investment's profitability. 

**Programming Skills/Tools/Concpets Used:**

>- Python
>-   Pandas
>-   PyWebIO
>- Jupyter Notebooks
>- Full Stack Development
>- Testing and Debugging
>- Virtual Environments (environment.yml files)
